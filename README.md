# Goals

Building a full example to solve a common business problem along with learning, and practicing new technologies in both DevOps and software Development such as:

- **Frontend**: Learning and practicing modern frontend frameworks, tools (NextJS, Remix, React native, CRA, etc)

- **Backend**: Learning and practicing microservices-based architecture, better understanding its pros and cons while developing a real project.
- **GraphQL**: Learning and building a [Hybrid approach](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/3-big-picture/). Interested in [federation architecture](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) for better support backend microservices
- **Caching**: Backend distributed caching and frontend graphql client caching
- **Message Queue**: A message queue for asynchronous communication between microservices
- **Logging**: End to end logging
- **Mornitoring**: Mornitoring the entire application with modern tools (using both cloud services or opensource libraries), including sending alerts, synthetic monitoring, etc.
- **Security**: Learning and Building applications with security in mind.
- **Monorepo**: Learning and practicing both software development, building the CI/CD pipeline, all in one with monorepo support.
